# CodeAlpha Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify Iris flower species
(Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal
measurements using a machine learning model.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset
- Iris dataset (available in Scikit-learn)

## ✅ Results
- Achieved *100% accuracy* on test data
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## 📝 Conclusion
The model performed exceptionally well due to the clear separability
of the Iris dataset, especially using petal length and petal width
features
