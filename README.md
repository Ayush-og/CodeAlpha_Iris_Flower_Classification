# CodeAlpha Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha.

## 📌 Project Description
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into
three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal
and petal measurements. A machine learning model is trained to learn
patterns from the data and accurately predict the species.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset
- Iris dataset (built-in dataset from Scikit-learn)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Loaded the Iris dataset
2. Performed data exploration and visualization
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Standardized features
5. Trained Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated model performance

## ✅ Results
- Achieved *100% accuracy* on test data
- Performance evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## 📝 Conclusion
The model achieved perfect accuracy due to the simplicity and clear
separation of classes in the Iris dataset, especially using petal
measurements.
